#JARVIS

######What is JARVIS?

JARVIS stands for 'Just A Rather Very Impractical System'.  It is a take on the 
intelligent operating system in Iron Man (also called JARVIS).  JARVIS is a simple
OS to demonstrate the concepts and fundamentals of what occurs when a computer 
boots up and the necessary tasks to initialize the environment for an operating
system to be loaded and trasferred control to.  This implies that once the computer 
has been initialized, the OS takes over control of the computer.

######What will it take to get JARVIS up and running?

Going into this project, there was only one goal; that goal was to understand each
and individual hardware and software component involved to run an OS on IBM PC
compatibles.  Hence JARVIS will only run on i386/amd64 architecture integrated
with a BIOS.
